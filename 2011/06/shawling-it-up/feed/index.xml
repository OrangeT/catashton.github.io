		<description><![CDATA[Hi just to say well done on your shawls.....they look really good...

I have been knitting shawls  mostly baby shawls..for many years, and have always got one on the go. Most recent for my Great Grandson Jenson...
The dressing of the shawl makes all the difference, and you can appreciate the patterns.
I do all kinds of knitting and always enjoy a challenge.

Best wishes for your Big Day..
