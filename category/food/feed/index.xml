<p>Been a bit of a busy year. What with the death of Hannah and Apollo, followed by the addition of Cinder, later going to DWcon and our wedding in October, this year has been a long one. </p>
<p>I thought I&#8217;d take a different approach to Christmas, I didn&#8217;t have much time to knit gifts this year. This year I&#8217;ve been baking for folk. These are a lovely simple addition to the hampers I&#8217;ve made up. </p>
<p>To make these you need:<br />
4 250ml Kilner jars</p>
<p>Base:<br />
8 Oreo cookies<br />
25g melted butter</p>
<p>Filling:<br />
200g soft cheese<br />
200g Nutella<br />
1/2 tsp vanilla extract</p>
<p>Topping:<br />
A few chocolate drops(optional)</p>
<p>Method<br />
1) turn the Oreos into breadcrumbs in a blender (or bash in a bag with a rolling pin)<br />
2) mix in the melted butter<br />
3) press the base mixture into the bottom of the jars<br />
4) cream the Nutella and soft cheese together, until completely combined<br />
5) stir in the vanilla, making sure to mix thoroughly<br />
6) dollop filling into jar, on top of base, making sure there are no gaps<br />
7) sprinkle on chocolate drops if desired.</p>

<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been on a bit of a splurge on cooking real food.  Kian&#8217;s dad took me to <a href="http://www.wingyipstore.co.uk/">Wing Yip&#8217;s Manchester store</a> just before university term started. I picked up many things including stuff to make wontons.</p>
<p>If you fancy some let me know &#8211; I&#8217;m happy to make more here at Tentacle Tower.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started a gallery for <a href="/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=3329&amp;g2_highlightId=3334">Food</a> photography.  I&#8217;ve been doing much of it lately.  I seem to be enjoying cooking and the photography that goes with it.</p>

<p>For months I&#8217;ve been trying to find something I could claim as a &#8220;Cat Safe&#8221; Hot Chocolate.  Now, most cafes pile on cream, most powder versions have enough skimmed milk powder in them to trigger my intolerance and most chocolate bars I have to consume in moderation so I can&#8217;t use it to make a Hot Chocolate.  Well that changed when I found that I could eat Aero &#8211; I somewhat love Aero.  Somewhat hate Nestle, but I can&#8217;t do much about that.</p>
<p>Dried Skimmed Milk itself doesn&#8217;t seem to affect me much.</p>
<p><u>Ingredients for &#8220;Cat Safe&#8221; Hot Chocolate</u><br />
Aero 4 <strong>mini treat size bars (around 40g)</strong> (of which is ~6g milk solids of that between 0.12g and 0.48g may be lactose)<br />
a mug full of <strong>full-fat milk</strong> (lactofree or normal)<br />
a tiny grating of <strong>nutmeg</strong><br />
a handful of <strong>marshmallows</strong></p>
<p><u>Method</u></p>
<ol>
<li>Heat the milk and chocolate over a gentle heat &#8211; DO NOT BOIL! Keep on heat until all the chocolate is melted in.</li>
<li>Once the chocolate is combined with the milk grate in as much nutmeg as you like (you can leave it out if you don&#8217;t like it!)</li>
<li>Pour into mug (for preference a Large Mug).</li>
<li>Cut up some marshmallows and top. (May need a spoon to consume this awesome drink/dessert.. )</li>
</ol>
<p>*It may not be <strong>strictly</strong> Lactose Free, but it hasn&#8217;t upset my body so I&#8217;m happy to say I can make it again for me.</p>
