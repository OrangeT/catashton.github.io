<p>Today I saw Shakespeare 4 Kids perform The Tempest. If you get the chance, go see them. It was fantastic just to see the school groups so completely engrossed in the stage. I didn&#8217;t see any child not utterly raptured by the stage.   </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been lacking in creative juices.  This has meant that I&#8217;ve done very little work for Uni.  So on Saturday I thought &#8220;What did I used to do when I couldn&#8217;t get work done??&#8221;  I had a rather useful idea of painting.  I haven&#8217;t painted anything in a while.</p>
<p>For my materials and process project I&#8217;m looking at the effects of Bi-Polar Disorder on the visual perception.  I started with the title &#8220;loss of insight&#8221; &#8211; words chosen at random from a conversation with my mother over my sister&#8217;s recent mental health troubles (asking whether it was loss of insight or realisation of needing help).</p>
<p>So today I present to you my latest painting!</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=1455&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" /></p>
<p>The image that I used to paint from was one I took at the Imperial War Museum North (in Salford Quays).</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=1459&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" /></p>
<p>The painting has really got my head into gear.  I now need to get some sketchbook work done!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I had a one day project at university.  Our brief was to take a fork, apple and a digital camera to work with Composition.</p>
<p>I took my camera (Canon 10D with Tamron 28-75mm f2.8 lens), tripod, flash gun (Vivitar 285VH and sync cable), flash metre, apple, fork, the rest of my lunch and some tissues.  With that jolly list I created 12 images, some of them are good, some are bad and some are just plain ugly!</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&#038;g2_itemId=1063&#038;g2_serialNumber=2" alt="Fork" /><br />
This image is simply called <i>Fork</i>. </p>
<p><a href="/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=1051">This is the gallery</a> for the rest of the collection.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy them as much as I do.  As always I&#8217;d love some comments and or critique.</p>
