				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the past few weeks I&#8217;ve been lacking in creative juices.  This has meant that I&#8217;ve done very little work for Uni.  So on Saturday I thought &#8220;What did I used to do when I couldn&#8217;t get work done??&#8221;  I had a rather useful idea of painting.  I haven&#8217;t painted anything in a while.</p>
<p>For my materials and process project I&#8217;m looking at the effects of Bi-Polar Disorder on the visual perception.  I started with the title &#8220;loss of insight&#8221; &#8211; words chosen at random from a conversation with my mother over my sister&#8217;s recent mental health troubles (asking whether it was loss of insight or realisation of needing help).</p>
<p>So today I present to you my latest painting!</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=1455&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" /></p>
<p>The image that I used to paint from was one I took at the Imperial War Museum North (in Salford Quays).</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=1459&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" /></p>
<p>The painting has really got my head into gear.  I now need to get some sketchbook work done!</p>
