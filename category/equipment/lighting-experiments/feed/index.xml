<p>With the night&#8217;s drawing in (note these photos were taken between 4:50pm and 4:55pm) I thought I&#8217;d look to the evening lighting at The Lowry and around Media City UK. </p>
<p>Just a few for now &#8211; was in a rush to get to a birthday party and had no tripod!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I ended up in the studio on recommendation of one of my tutor.  To get comfortable about going into the studio before taking other people in there for a project I&#8217;m currently doing for my degree.</p>
<p>I was given the choice of two cameras, a <a href="http://www.antiquecameras.net/fuji6x76x9.html">Fuji 6&#215;9</a> (which I used in <a href="/gallery/portraits-and-lighting-playtime/studio6x9/">first year</a>) and a <a href="http://www.mamiya.com/rb67-pro-sd.html">Mamiya RB67</a>.  I thought I&#8217;d play with something I&#8217;d yet to have time with so chose the Mamiya with a 120 back.</p>
<p>The exercise started with me shooting a film with my eyes closed.</p>
<p><a href="/gallery/portraits-and-lighting-playtime/studio-exercise/" ><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self19-244x300.jpg" alt="" title="Self19" width="244" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-900" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self19-244x300.jpg 244w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self19-122x150.jpg 122w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self19.jpg 833w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></a><a href="/gallery/portraits-and-lighting-playtime/studio-exercise/"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self15-244x300.jpg" alt="" title="Self15" width="244" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-899" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self15-244x300.jpg 244w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self15-122x150.jpg 122w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self15.jpg 833w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></a><a href="/gallery/portraits-and-lighting-playtime/studio-exercise/" ><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self12-244x300.jpg" alt="" title="Self12" width="244" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-898" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self12-244x300.jpg 244w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self12-122x150.jpg 122w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self12.jpg 833w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></a><a href="/gallery/portraits-and-lighting-playtime/studio-exercise/" ><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self09-244x300.jpg" alt="" title="Self09" width="244" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-897" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self09-244x300.jpg 244w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self09-122x150.jpg 122w, /wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Self09.jpg 833w" sizes="(max-width: 244px) 100vw, 244px" /></a></p>
<p>By the end of the exercise I had my eyes open and trying to pose &#8211; you would not believe how hard I find it to pose in front of a camera!</p>
<p>The lighting was setup in this way so that it would not distract from the simplicity of the photographs themselves.</p>
<p>The aim of the session was to get me to look at simple lighting akin to David Bailey, Sally Man and Richard Avedon to try to open up the possibilities of a series of portraits I&#8217;m currently shooting.  I may have more from this set (I&#8217;ve got photographs of two other people too and if they will let me post them I&#8217;ll share them with you lot!).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In recent weeks I realised that I had no up to date photographs of the cats.  Recently we got some <a href="http://thecamlab.com/?page_id=153">“Yongnuo” CTR-301P Wireless Flash Trigger</a>, which frankly they are the best set of triggers I&#8217;ve had my hands on.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve been playing with the new triggers and off camera flash.  At the moment I&#8217;m only playing with a single flash gun (although I can up to a second thanks to the <a href="http://strobist.blogspot.com/2007/02/return-of-classic.html">Vivitar 285HV</a> working happily with the triggers).</p>
<p>In no particular order</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&#038;g2_itemId=3254.jpg" /><br />
Hannah (aged 12 years)</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&#038;g2_itemId=3257.jpg" /><br />
Hathor (aged 6 years)</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&#038;g2_itemId=3259.jpg" /><br />
Henery (aged 8 years)</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&#038;g2_itemId=3261.jpg" /><br />
Seti (aged 6 years)</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&#038;g2_itemId=3263.jpg" /><br />
Squeaker (aged 4 years)</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&#038;g2_itemId=3265.jpg" /><br />
Walnut (aged 16 months)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all the cats, bar Apollo (aged 4 years) who hasn&#8217;t been around to photograph for a few days.  I&#8217;ll be getting a photograph of him as soon as I possibly can.</p>
<p>Each of these photographs was taken in the cat&#8217;s favoured place.  Hannah being in bed, Seti near my dad in the living room, Walnut on the stairs, Henery on top of the fridge, Hathor under the bed and Squeaker at the top of the stairs (well he likes to hide..).  So I hope you like them.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t much in the mood for arranging my face today so I thought I&#8217;d try an idea that&#8217;s been bouncing around my head for a few days &#8211; a blurred, backlit portrait. </p>
<p>Take:<br />
Canon 10D<br />
Vivitar 285HV<br />
Stofen<br />
Cable release<br />
PC Sync cable<br />
tripod<br />
lighting stand<br />
and a blank piece of wall</p>
<p>Mix together in an appropriate way.  Camera pointing at subject, flash (on 1/2 power) with stofen behind subject at shoulder height.  Subject, in this case, holding the cable release.  Auto-focus off and focused at the very minimum.  </p>
<p>The only post-processing done &#8211; added a vignette, image size and saved as jpg! </p>

&#8220;Captured with Canon 10D, on camera flash with a home-made &#8220;stofen&#8221;-like defuser about a foot away from the subject. The defuser is made out of a film reel canister with a cut about a cm wide to accommodate the flash unit.&#8221;</p>
<p>For a while I&#8217;ve been having to use sheets of paper with any photograph that needed flash (and not using the Vivitar 285HV) with under 5ft between camera and subject (many of my portraits, macro-ish shots, etc) to defuse the on board flash.  Well, no more!  I now have a defuser and it came free with film! </p>
<p>On top of all that &#8211; I&#8217;ve not had to edit the file, just convert it to jpg. </p>

<p>The last few days I&#8217;ve been playing around with the flashgun and how to use the light on camera.  Trying to get my head around how to use this strobe in portraits on the go and with little prep.  </p>
<p>The strobe is in the hot-shoe so, about 4inches above lens, pointed straight forwards at the subject(ie, me) on 1/16th power.  75mm, 1/125th sec, f.4.  Used a hand trigger &#8211; wired clone &#8211; and tripod slightly higher than the default height. </p>
<p>This photo is manually focused and for once looks to be spot on.. </p>
<p>So what do you think of the colour??  It was meant to be a redy-brown, but it is over my old purple hair.  <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> </p>
