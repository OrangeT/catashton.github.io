				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 28th January we were broken into.  Sadly, my laptop, Wii and 360 were taken.  They also tried to take the film scanner, but left it without a power supply.  They have also damaged the TV amp.</p>
<p>This does however mean that I&#8217;ve lost about 6 months worth of work.  Everything I&#8217;ve done since about August (except certain shoots that have been printed off-site) is gone.  This also includes my Project 365 which I was about 8 weeks from concluding!  </p>
<p>In the past month we have replaced the scanner power pack, my laptop, the kitchen window and we&#8217;re in the process of sorting the other stolen things.  Project 365 will restart on March 16th &#8211; my 21st birthday! </p>
<p>Also got a back-up solution being tested atm.  Now time to get on.  </p>
