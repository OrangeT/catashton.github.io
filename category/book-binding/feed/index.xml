				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I spent the day binding a book.  It took about 12 hours &#8211; first attempt at a multi section fully bound book.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=1425&amp;g2_serialNumber=2" /></p>
<p>I found the fabric at the mill down the road for £2 a metre.  I saw it and thought it would make a great book cover.  Its a rather stiff cotton print &#8211; so well suited to being a book cover.</p>
<p>The guide book to making this book was rather confusing and I&#8217;ll be finding another at the university library to help with the next project (which I start asap &#8211; got the brief today).</p>
<p>If anyone is interested I&#8217;ll write up a how-to bookbind in this style.  Its simple once you work out what the book is trying to say/describe.</p>

<p>For Christmas I was set a project to &#8220;capture&#8221; moments of meal times over the Christmas period.  We were restricted to using only disposable cameras.  Instead of leaving it to someone else to process and develop my films/prints I decided to use and abuse the machines at uni.  This did, however, have one drawback &#8211; the deadline!  I was meant to present this to my class on the first Monday back rather than a week later like I thought&#8230;</p>
<p>On the Monday morning I processed the films and took the book I had been making to keep my Polaroids of the family.  I was going to keep that to myself, but I needed to present something!  I&#8217;ve still to finish making that <a href="/?p=11">book</a> &#8211; the housing is built and the pages are all together, but the stuff I want to write in it hasn&#8217;t made its way onto the pages.</p>
<p>By Wednesday I had colour paper so I could do prints from my films.  My friend, Nat, showed me how to start making prints and I managed in 2 hours to produce a contact print and a final print that were colour balanced and ready to be shown to people!!</p>
<p>I even managed to focus the negative myself!!  (I sometimes struggle with it if I do it myself &#8211; at home I get Kian to check it for me!!)</p>
<p>So this next week I&#8217;ll be printing up to 6 more prints from this one roll (Christmas Day at my parents&#8217; house).</p>

<p>This morning I have been making a book to hold my Christmas photos and feelings.  I thought I&#8217;d share it with you.  </p>
<p>The paper came from the selection that my mum had for this year&#8217;s wrapping (I would have used the paper I got on my presents, but that was thrown out!  Twice!!).  </p>
<p>Later I shall be filling it with my images and art from Christmas at my parents&#8217; house, Kian&#8217;s parents&#8217; house and New Years party. </p>
