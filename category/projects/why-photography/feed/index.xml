<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=2981.jpg" /><br />
This is <a href="http://www.pixelenvy.co.uk/">Nick Harris</a>, a <a href="http://www.geekup.org/">GeekUp</a> regular.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=2999.jpg" /><br />
Newly fixed pinhole camera cap for my Canon bodies.  Just in time for <a href="http://www.pinholeday.org/">Pinhole Photography Day</a> &#8211; this coming Sunday.</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=2972.jpg" /><br />
Kian took me up Rivington &#8211; ended up getting a dent in the driver&#8217;s door on the car that day!  But also went up Rivington for the first time (nevermind living here for 3 years nearly!)</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=2978.jpg" /><br />
This is my friend <a href="http://www.artfusions.co.uk/Artists/jenna%20smith.htm">Jenna</a>.  She&#8217;s somewhat shy around cameras..</p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&amp;g2_itemId=2969.jpg" /><br />
Walnut has turned rather photogenic lately &#8211; not like she hasn&#8217;t been all along &#8211; just more so recently!</p>
<p><a href="/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=2866">The rest of the gallery</a>.</p>
<p>Right I&#8217;d better go get ready for <a href="http://www.wewillrockyou.co.uk/">We Will Rock You!(be warned there be music!)</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today was the first set of shoots for my project &#8220;Why Photography?&#8221; which will be exhibited in late April/early May.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tootdood/3334736491/">Tootdood&#8217;s metaphoto</a> (photograph of a photograph being taken&#8230;etc..) </p>
<p>The first person I was intending to see was <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tootdood/">Tootdood</a>.  He was the first person I could arrange to see about why he does photography.  I was very pleased that Tootdood introduced me to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/airadam/">AirAdam</a>.  Adam agreed to join the project too.  Which makes him another of my favorite people! </p>
<p>While photographing AirAdam, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixel-eight/">Pixel.Eight</a> wandered across us.  Once AirAdam wandered to do some more photography, myself and Pixel.Eight wandered around Market Street, Piccadilly Gardens and upto Victoria train station too, chatting and discussion photography.  </p>
<p>Today I have shot 18 frames on the Mamiya C220 with either the 55mm or 80mm lenses.  Been using Kodak Tri-X 400.  Gonna dev in Kodak TMAX when I&#8217;ve finished the second roll.  </p>
<p>Looking forward to further shooting!   </p>
