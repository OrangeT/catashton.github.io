<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been on a bit of a splurge on cooking real food.  Kian&#8217;s dad took me to <a href="http://www.wingyipstore.co.uk/">Wing Yip&#8217;s Manchester store</a> just before university term started. I picked up many things including stuff to make wontons.</p>
<p>If you fancy some let me know &#8211; I&#8217;m happy to make more here at Tentacle Tower.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve started a gallery for <a href="/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=3329&amp;g2_highlightId=3334">Food</a> photography.  I&#8217;ve been doing much of it lately.  I seem to be enjoying cooking and the photography that goes with it.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last 24 hours I&#8217;ve been changing things around on here and in the <a href="/gallery">gallery</a>.  I now have a running colour scheme throughout and typeface.  The gallery now works relatively close to what I wanted 18months ago&#8230; </p>
<p>In addition to the redesign stuff I&#8217;ve added a <a href="/?page_id=97">Print Sale</a> where I&#8217;ve chosen my favourite images and more (go have a read for details!).  I also have updated the gallery with a <a href="/gallery/main.php?g2_itemId=3191">wedding</a> section from the recent wedding work I&#8217;ve been doing (now taking bookings for the remainder of 2009 and throughout 2010).  </p>
<p><img src="/gallery/main.php?g2_view=core.DownloadItem&#038;g2_itemId=3243" alt="TessaTiger"></p>
<p>Reminder:<br />
I&#8217;m available for events, portraits, fine art commissions, weddings, food and product shots. <a href="/?page_id=87">Email or phone</a> me for a chat about anything you&#8217;d like me to help you with. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today a new theme has gone live on my <a href="/">photoblog</a>.  It is <a href="http://mac-host.com/slidingdoor/">Sliding Door</a> by <a href="http://macintoshhowto.com/">Wayne</a>.  Thanks to <a href="http://purplegrasshopper.co.uk/">NovaWildstar</a> for pointing me at it.</p>
<p>All this is a face lift that&#8217;s been on the cards for a while &#8211; the exhibition opening Monday was just a kick up the butt to get it done!</p>
<p>Now I just need to sort my gallery theme/solution.</p>
<p>Also done some general rejigging of the categories and pages &#8211; also all my linked pages now resolve(even if there&#8217;s nothing in one of the files!)!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the 28th January we were broken into.  Sadly, my laptop, Wii and 360 were taken.  They also tried to take the film scanner, but left it without a power supply.  They have also damaged the TV amp.</p>
<p>This does however mean that I&#8217;ve lost about 6 months worth of work.  Everything I&#8217;ve done since about August (except certain shoots that have been printed off-site) is gone.  This also includes my Project 365 which I was about 8 weeks from concluding!  </p>
<p>In the past month we have replaced the scanner power pack, my laptop, the kitchen window and we&#8217;re in the process of sorting the other stolen things.  Project 365 will restart on March 16th &#8211; my 21st birthday! </p>
<p>Also got a back-up solution being tested atm.  Now time to get on.  </p>
